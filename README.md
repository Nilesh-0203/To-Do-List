# To-Do-List
🚀 Just launched my latest project - a stylish To-Do List app! 📝 Built with the power trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design is clean, the functionality is seamless, and it even features local storage for persistent data. 🌐💡

🎨 The UI is on point, thanks to a gradient background, Poppins font, and carefully chosen colors. The input field and button are neatly aligned in a flex container. Plus, the task list has a cool visual touch with checkboxes and a delete icon.

🧠 Implemented logic to handle user interactions - adding tasks, marking them as completed with a satisfying strikethrough effect, and removing tasks with a click on the delete icon.

📲 Mobile-responsive and hosted on the web, this To-Do List app is a testament to my continuous learning journey in web development. 🔗 Check it out and let me know what you think! #WebDevelopment #JavaScriptMagic #HTMLCSS #CodingAdventures 🚀💻
